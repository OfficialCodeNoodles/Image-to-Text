# Image to Text

A basic converter to display digital images as text characters. 

## Description

This is a Python program that can output an image as rows of text characters. I recomend that you use the terminal as it's background is black and it can be scaled using the scroll wheel. Note: This program is very bare bones and doesn't contain any exception handling but feel free to add some if necessary.

### Dependencies

* Python 3+
* PIL

### Executing program

Put all images you want to convert into the folder with this application. Run the application type the file name of the image and give a new size. Make sure you use a valid image format that PIL can open.
